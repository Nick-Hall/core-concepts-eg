# Use cases

This is a list of use cases which will be used to help analyze how well each model
handles different scenarios and data which the CCEG has deemed worthy of consideration.
The list is not meant to be complete in terms of all possibilities but is intended
to be complete in its exercise of the data model's abilities to handle persons, events,
and relationships.
